## Work that would still need to be completed if this was an actual product
### Many more tests need to be added.
- db incorrect strings
- db incorrect integers
- db sql injection

### api additions
-  get api tests working correctly
-  explore and expand to utilize more external api features

### CD/CI
- github actions executes testing when new pull request

### DB actions
- santize inputs from sql injection
- expand on functionality
- get all by, name, region, type, etc.
- be able to UPDATE poke in db

### misc
- either user swagger for spec page and or get it rendering correctly
- find replacement for sleep in create_app
- PokemonAPI probably does not need to be a class
- ensure that all logging is working
- consider more conventional dir and file naming convention
- further clean up code
